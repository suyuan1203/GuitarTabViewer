GuitarTabViewer
===============
You need install web.py before you run the code.

python index.py 1234

Then access http://0.0.0.0:1234

You can only use the web.py build-in server. It doesn't work under apache2.

Most of the code are from a chrome app GuitarTabViewer.

The original code doesn't work because it uses ajax call to download files from other domain.
